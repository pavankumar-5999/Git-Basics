| **VCS (Version Control System)**           | A Version Control System is a tool that helps track changes to source code over time, manage multiple versions of files, and enable collaboration among multiple developers while maintaining history, rollback, and auditability.       |
| **Git**                                    | Git is a distributed version control system that allows developers to track changes locally, work offline, create branches efficiently, and merge code safely. It is fast, scalable, and widely used in DevOps and software development. |
| **GitHub**                                 | GitHub is a cloud‑based Git repository hosting service that provides collaboration features such as pull requests, code reviews, issue tracking, CI/CD integrations, and access control on top of Git.                                   |
| **Bitbucket**                              | Bitbucket is a Git repository management platform by Atlassian that integrates closely with Jira and other Atlassian tools, commonly used in enterprise environments for source control and team collaboration.                          |
| **Azure Repos**                            | Azure Repos is a version control service in Azure DevOps that provides Git repositories and TFVC, enabling teams to manage code, collaborate, and integrate with CI/CD pipelines in the Azure ecosystem.                                 |
| **TFVC (Team Foundation Version Control)** | TFVC is a centralized version control system in Azure DevOps where code is stored on a central server and developers must be connected to check in changes, unlike Git which is distributed.                                             |
